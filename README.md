Wagez-3.0

This is the third iteration of a shift-time/money-earned calculator! Users can enter their shift start and end times, as well as their hourly wage and after pressing 'Do Math' their total time worked and money earned are displayed for them. Users also have the option to include their break start and end times which will be deducted from their total time worked, as well as their total money earned.

This project uses NextJS (App Router). It is optimized for use on a mobile browser, and is fully deployed and usable at: https://wagez.vercel.app/
